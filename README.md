chose one of the following two
make a scatter plot for “use intensity from the second closest point”
make a scatter plot for “pick a random intensity from the neighborhood” (this won’t use any machine learning… just pick a random point in the largest neighborhood and use that true intensity for that point… this is intended to be a random baseline to see what terrible performance would be)
