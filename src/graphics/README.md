This folder contains graphics and media for the lidar-harmonization repo. Manim was used to create the video. 

Note: I wasn't able to successfully run the manim animation scripts with cairo version 1.16 (which is the highest version available from anaconda). I had to install conda 1.17 on my system before things worked.
